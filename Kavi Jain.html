<p>Since its invention a little over 130 years ago, the               interview has become a commonplace of journalism. Today, almost everybody who is illiterate will have read an interview at some point in their lives, while from the other point of view, several thousand celebrities have been interviewed over the yeaars, some of them repeatedly.</p>
<pre>So it is hardly surprising that opinions of the interview of its functions, methods<br> and merits vary considerably. Some                might make quite extravagant claims for it as being, <br>in its highest form, a source of truth, and, in its practice, an art.<br>Others, usually celebrities who see themselves as its victims, might despise<br>the interview as an unwarranted intrusion into their lives, or feel that it somehow <br>diminishes them, just as in some primitives cultures it is believed that if one takes <br>
photographic portrait of somebody then one is stealig that person's soul.</pre>

<p>Pancake was the brand name of the makeup material that Gemini Studios bought in truck loads. Greta Garbo must have used it, Miss Gohar must have used it, Vyjayantimala must also have used it but Rati Agnihotri may not have heard of it. The makeupdepatment of the Gemini Studios was in the upstairs of a building that was believed to have been Robert Clive's stables. A dozen other building in the city are said to have been his residence. For his brief life and eb=ven breifer stay in Madras, Robert Clive seems to have done a lot of moving, besides fighting some impossible battles in remote corners of India and marrying a maiden n St. Mary's Church in Fort St.George in Madras.Pancake was the brand name of the makeup material that Gemini Studios boughtin truck loads.

<p id ="local">Gemini Studios was the favourite haunt of poets like S.D.S Yogiar, Sanghu Subramanyam, Krishna Sastry and Harindranath Chattopadhyaya. It had an excellent mess which supplied good coffee at all times of the day and for most part of thenigt. Those were the days when Congress rule meant prohibition and meeting over a cup of coffee was rather satisfying entertainring. Barring the office boys and a couple of clerks, everybody else at the studios radiated leisure, a pre-requisite for poetry. Most ofthem wore khadi and worshipped Gandhiji but beyond that they had not the faintest appreciation for political thought of any kind. Naturally, they were all averse to theterm 'Communism'. A Communist was a godless man he had no filial or conjugal love; he had no compunction about killing his own parents or his children; he always out to cause andspread unrest and violence among innocent and ignorant people. Such notions which prevailed everywhere else in South India at that time also, naturally, floated about vaguely among khadi-clad poets of Gemini Studios. Evidence of it was soon forthcoming.Gemini Studios was the favourite haunt of poets like S.D.S Yogiar, Sanghu Subramanyam, Krishna Sastry and Harindranath Chattopadhyaya.
